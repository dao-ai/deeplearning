00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:07,133
this next video is on inferring

00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:08,600
I like to think of these tasks

00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,766
where the model takes a text as input and

00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:12,133
perform some kind of analysis

00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,200
so this could be

00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:16,200
extracting labels extracting names

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,133
kind of understanding the sentiment of a text

00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:18,966
that kind of thing

00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:21,533
so if you want to

00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:22,533
extract a sentiment

00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,366
positive or negative of a piece of text

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,000
in traditional machine learning workflow

00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:29,500
you'd have to collect the label dataset

00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:30,966
train the model

00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,933
figure out how to deploy the model somewhere in the

00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,200
cloud and make inferences

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,933
and that can work pretty well but it was

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,966
just a lot of work

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,533
to go through that process

00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:41,700
and also for every toss such as sentiment

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,733
versus extracting names versus something else

00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:44,733
you have to train

00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:46,800
and deploy a separate model

00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:49,933
one of the really nice things about Lash Language Model

00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,400
is that for many tasks like these

00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,100
you can just

00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,733
write a prompt and have it start generating results

00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:56,133
pretty much right away

00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,066
and that gives

00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:59,933
tremendous speed in terms of application development

00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,366
and you can also just use one model one API

00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,366
to do many different

00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:06,366
tiles rather than needing to figure out how to

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,166
train and deploy a lot of different models

00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,133
and so with that

00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,933
let's jump into the code to see

00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13,566
how you can take advantage of this

00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,933
so here's a usual starter code

00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:18,500
um just run that

00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:19,866
and

00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:23,000
the motivating example I'm going to use is a review

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,700
for a lap so

00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:27,000
need a nice lap of the bedroom

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,400
and this one additional storage and so on

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,733
so

00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,700
let me write a prompt

00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:37,766
to classify the sentiment of this

00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:40,700
and if I want the system to tell me

00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,366
what is the sentiment

00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,866
I can just write what is the sentiment

00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,266
of the following

00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:53,566
product review

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,366
with the usual delimiter or the review text and so on

00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:02,333
and let's run that

00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:06,533
and this says the sentiment of the product review is

00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:10,166
positive which is actually seems pretty right

00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,600
this lamp isn't perfect

00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,500
but this customer seems pretty happy

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,966
it seems you're a great company that cares about the

00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:15,733
customers of products

00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,133
so I think positive

00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:19,066
sentiment seems like the right answer

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,200
now this prints out the entire sentence

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,066
the sentencement of the project review is positive

00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,466
if you wanted to give a more concise response

00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:28,733
to make it easier

00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,366
for post processing

00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,400
I can take this prompt and add another instruction to

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,400
give you answers

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,733
a single word either positive or negative

00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,666
so it just prints out positive like this

00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,733
which makes it easier

00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,533
for a piece of text to take dissolve points and

00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:44,866
process it and do something with it

00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,200
let's look at another prompt

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,400
again instead of using the lab review

00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,500
here I have it

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,566
identify a list of emotions at the right

00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:56,466
of the following reviews

00:02:56,466 --> 00:03:00,000
expressing include no more than 5 items in this list

00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:04,533
so launch language models are pretty good at extracting

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,966
specific things

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,700
all of a piece of text in this case we're expressing

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,100
the emotions and this could be useful for understanding

00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,666
how your customers

00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:16,700
think about the particular product

00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,133
for longer customer support

00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,766
organizations is important to

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,100
understand if a particular user is extremely upset

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,566
so you might have a

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,066
different classification problem like this

00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:31,866
is the right to the final review expressing anger

00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:34,300
because if someone is really angry it might

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
merit paying extra attention

00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,566
to have a customer review

00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,800
to have customer support or customer success

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,066
reach out to figure what's going on and

00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:44,700
make things right for the customer

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,366
in this case the customer is not angry

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,166
and notice that

00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:51,066
with supervised learning

00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,400
if I had wanted to build all of these

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,166
classifiers there's no way

00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,366
I would have

00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:59,000
been able to do this with supervised learning in

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,766
just a few minutes that you saw me do so in this video

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,400
I encourage you to pause this video and

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,333
try changing some of these prompts

00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,066
maybe ask if the customer is

00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:11,200
expressing delight or ask if

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,266
there are any missing parts

00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,900
and see if you can get the prompt to

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,133
make different inferences about this lap review

00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:23,266
let me show some more

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,866
things that you can do with this system specifically

00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:32,700
extracting richer information from a customer review

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,066
so information extraction is the part of NLP

00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,700
of national language processing

00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,933
that relates to taking a piece of text

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,933
and extracting certain things that you want to know

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,100
from the text

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,733
so in this prompt I'm asking it

00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:50,800
identify the following items

00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:53,566
the item purchase and

00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,600
enable the company that made the item

00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,700
again if you are trying to summarize many reviews

00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,466
from an online shopping ecommerce website

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,866
it might be useful for your lash collection reviews

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,600
to figure out what were the items who made the item

00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:11,766
figure out positive and negative sentiment

00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:14,666
to track trends about positive or negative sentiment

00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,933
for specific items or for specific

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,300
manufacturers

00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:22,133
and in this example I'm going to ask it to format

00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,133
your response as adjacent object

00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,200
with item and brand as the keys

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,733
and so if I do that

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,000
this says the item is a lamp the brand is Luminar

00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,333
and you can easily load this into Python dictionary

00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,966
to then do additional processing on this output

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,700
in the examples we've gone through

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,466
you saw how to write a prompt

00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,533
to recognize the sentiment

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,866
figure out if someone is angry and also

00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,533
extract the item and the brand

00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,733
one way to extract all of this information

00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,766
would be to use 3 or 4 prompts and co

00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:05,466
get completion you know 3 times or 4 times extract

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
these different views one at a time

00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:11,300
but it turns out you can actually write a single prompt

00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:14,300
to extract all of this information at the same time

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,066
so let's say identify the fine items

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,533
extract sentiment

00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,100
as reviewer expressing anger

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,666
item purchase completely made it

00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,466
and then here

00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:26,866
I'm also

00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:30,300
going to tell it to format the anger value as a

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,500
brilliant value

00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,166
and let me run that

00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:36,400
and this opens a

00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,133
JSON

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,366
where sentiment is positive anger

00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:45,133
and did no quotes around faults because it also just

00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,800
operates as a broodier value

00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,533
they extracted the items

00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,766
lamp with additional storage instead of lamp

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,666
seems okay

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,566
but this way you can extract multiple fields

00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:56,933
out of a piece of text

00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,866
with just a single prompt

00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:03,366
and as usual please feel free to pause the video

00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:05,866
and play with different variations on this yourself

00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,100
or maybe even try

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,400
tupping in a totally different

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,900
review to see if we can still extract these things

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,900
accurately

00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:17,900
now one of the cool applications of seeing the large

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,100
language models is

00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,733
inferring topics

00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,600
given the long piece of text

00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,700
you know what is this

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,533
piece of text about what are the topics

00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:30,566
here is a fictitious newspaper article

00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,666
about how government workers uh feel about the agency

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,800
they work for

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,966
so the recent survey conducted by government

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,666
and so on results reviewed in NASA was a

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,600
popular department with high satisfaction rating

00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,100
I am a fan of NASA

00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,966
I love the work they do

00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,766
but this is a fictitious article

00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:51,200
and so given an article like this

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,966
we can ask it

00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,600
with this prompt

00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,700
determine five topics that are being discussed

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,266
in the following text

00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:03,933
let's make each item one or two words long

00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:05,366
for Mary response and a

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,100
comma separated list

00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:11,466
and so if we run that you know we get out this article

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,900
is about a government survey is about job satisfaction

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
is about announcer

00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:17,800
and so on so overall I think pretty nice

00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,533
extraction

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,966
of a list of topics and of course you can also

00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,500
split it so you get a

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,700
Python list with the 5 topics that

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,933
this article was about

00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,566
and if you have a collection of articles and

00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:36,800
extract topics

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,733
you can then also use

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,533
a large language model

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,500
to help you index into different topics

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,800
so let me use a slightly different topic list

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,766
let's say that

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,366
we're a news website or something

00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:51,500
and you know

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,200
these are the topics we try and also the government

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,800
engineering employee satisfaction

00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,800
federal governments and

00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,733
let's say you want to figure out

00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,300
given a news article

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,333
which of these topics are covered in that news article

00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,333
so here is a prompt that I can use

00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,266
I'm going to say

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,800
determine whether each item

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,666
the fund list of topics is a topic in the text below

00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:18,200
give the answer as a list of 01 for each topic

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,266
and so

00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,800
right so this is the same story text us before

00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:26,366
so this thing's a story it is about Nazir

00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,666
it's not about local government

00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,933
it's not about engineering

00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,566
it is about employee satisfaction then it is about

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,066
federal government

00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,333
so with this

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,300
in machine learning this is sometimes called a

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,000
zero shop learning

00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,866
algorithm because we didn't give it any training data

00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:43,666
that was label

00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,533
so that zero shot

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,700
and with just a prompt it was able to determine

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,266
which of these topics are covered in that news article

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,133
and so if you want to

00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:58,700
generate a news alert

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,700
say so that process news and you know

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
I really like a lot of the work that NASA does

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,400
so if you want to build a system that can take this

00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:09,066
you know

00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,666
put this information into a dictionary and whenever

00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,333
Nasser News pops out

00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,200
print alert new NASA story they can use this

00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:18,700
to very quickly take any article

00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,666
figure out what topics it is about

00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,700
and if the topic includes NASA

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,866
have it print out alert New NASA story

00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,400
oh just one thing I use this topic dictionary down here

00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:34,366
this prompt that I use up here isn't very robust

00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:36,200
if I went to the production system

00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,933
I would probably have it

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,766
I'll put the answer as a

00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,900
adjacent format

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,600
rather than as a list because the output

00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,366
of the Lash

00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:47,533
English model can be a little bit inconsistent

00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:50,166
so this is actually a pretty brilliant piece of cone

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,966
whether you want when you're done watching this video

00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,400
feel free to see if you can figure out how to

00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,700
modify this prompt to have it output

00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,966
JSON instead of a list like this and then

00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,366
have a more robust way

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,600
to tell if a bigger article is a story about NASA

00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,766
so that's it for inferring

00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:11,666
and in just a few minutes you can build

00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:15,466
multiple systems for making inferences about text

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,000
that previously does it have

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,166
taken days or even weeks for a

00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,300
skilled machine learning developer

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,733
and so I find this very exciting that

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
both for skilled machine learning developers

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,366
as well as for people that are

00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:29,933
newer to machine learning

00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:34,566
you can now use prompting to very quickly build and

00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:38,666
start making inferences on pretty complicated

00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,866
natural language processing tasks like these

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,133
in the next video we'll continue to talk about

00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:45,600
exciting things you could do

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,866
with large language models

00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,266
and we'll go on to

00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:51,400
transforming how you take one piece of text

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,900
and transform it into a different piece of text

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,600
such as translated to a different language

00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,566
let's go on to the next video
