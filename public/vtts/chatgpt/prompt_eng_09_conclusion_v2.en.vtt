00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.333
congratulations on making it to the end

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.466
of this short course

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.166
in summary in this short course you've Learned about

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.366
two key principles for prompting

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.200
right clearance

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.566
specific instructions and when it's appropriate

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.066
give them all the time to think

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.700
you also Learned about iterative

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.733
prompt development

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.200
and how having a process to get to the prompt is right

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.100
for your application is key

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.400
and we went through

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.100
a few capabilities of large

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.800
language models that are useful for many applications

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.000
specifically summarizing inferring

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.300
transforming and expanding

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.866
and you also saw how to build a custom chatbot

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:40.933
that was a lot

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.300
that you Learned in just one short course

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.333
and I hope you enjoyed going through these materials

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.533
we hope you'll come up with some

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.133
ideas for applications that you can

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.166
build yourself now

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.100
and please go try this out and let us

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.166
know what you come up with

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.733
no application is too small

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.300
it's you know

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.133
fine to start with something that's kind of

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:57.533
a very

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.866
small project with maybe a little bit of utility

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.800
or maybe it's not even useful at all

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.266
it's just something fun

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.200
yeah and I find

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.200
playing with these models actually really fun

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.466
so go play with it

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.933
yeah I agree it's a good weekend activity

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.100
speaking from experience

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.966
and just you know

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:15.266
please

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.366
use the learnings from your first project to build

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.766
about the second project and

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.566
you know maybe even about the third project

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:24.166
so on that's kind of how I have kind of

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.966
grown over time using these models myself as well

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.933
or if you have an idea for a bigger project already

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.200
just go for it

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.766
and you know as a reminder

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.100
these kind of large

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.200
language models are a very powerful technology

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.266
so it kind of goes without saying that we

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.166
ask you to use them responsibly

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:41.666
and please

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.933
only build things that will have a positive impact

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.300
fully agree I think in this age

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.466
people that built AI

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.500
systems can have a huge impact on others

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.266
so it's more important than ever that all of us

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.533
only use these tools responsibly

00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.000
and I think

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.566
building launch language model

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.600
based applications is just a very

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.800
exciting and drawing view right now

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.133
and now that you've finished this course

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:07.666
I think you now have a wealth of knowledge

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:08.933
to let you build

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:11.266
things that few people today know how to

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.300
so I hope you also help us to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.466
spread the word and encourage others

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.066
to take this course too

00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:20.466
in closing I hope you had fun during this course

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:21.966
and I want to thank you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.200
for finishing this course

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.100
and both easy

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.500
and I look forward to hearing about the amazing things

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.300
that you build
