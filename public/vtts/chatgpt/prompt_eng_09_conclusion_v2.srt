1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,333
congratulations on making it to the end

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:08,466
of this short course

3
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:12,166
in summary in this short course you've Learned about

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,366
two key principles for prompting

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,200
right clearance

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,566
specific instructions and when it's appropriate

7
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:19,066
give them all the time to think

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,700
you also Learned about iterative

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,733
prompt development

10
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:24,200
and how having a process to get to the prompt is right

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,100
for your application is key

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
and we went through

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,100
a few capabilities of large

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,800
language models that are useful for many applications

15
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,000
specifically summarizing inferring

16
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,300
transforming and expanding

17
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:39,866
and you also saw how to build a custom chatbot

18
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:40,933
that was a lot

19
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,300
that you Learned in just one short course

20
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,333
and I hope you enjoyed going through these materials

21
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:47,533
we hope you'll come up with some

22
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:49,133
ideas for applications that you can

23
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,166
build yourself now

24
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,100
and please go try this out and let us

25
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,166
know what you come up with

26
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:54,733
no application is too small

27
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:55,300
it's you know

28
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,133
fine to start with something that's kind of

29
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:57,533
a very

30
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,866
small project with maybe a little bit of utility

31
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,800
or maybe it's not even useful at all

32
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,266
it's just something fun

33
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,200
yeah and I find

34
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
playing with these models actually really fun

35
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,466
so go play with it

36
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:09,933
yeah I agree it's a good weekend activity

37
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,100
speaking from experience

38
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,966
and just you know

39
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:15,266
please

40
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:17,366
use the learnings from your first project to build

41
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:18,766
about the second project and

42
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:20,566
you know maybe even about the third project

43
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:24,166
so on that's kind of how I have kind of

44
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,966
grown over time using these models myself as well

45
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:29,933
or if you have an idea for a bigger project already

46
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:31,200
just go for it

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,766
and you know as a reminder

48
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:35,100
these kind of large

49
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,200
language models are a very powerful technology

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,266
so it kind of goes without saying that we

51
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,166
ask you to use them responsibly

52
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:41,666
and please

53
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,933
only build things that will have a positive impact

54
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:46,300
fully agree I think in this age

55
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,466
people that built AI

56
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:49,500
systems can have a huge impact on others

57
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,266
so it's more important than ever that all of us

58
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,533
only use these tools responsibly

59
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,000
and I think

60
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,566
building launch language model

61
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,600
based applications is just a very

62
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,800
exciting and drawing view right now

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,133
and now that you've finished this course

64
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,666
I think you now have a wealth of knowledge

65
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:08,933
to let you build

66
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,266
things that few people today know how to

67
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,300
so I hope you also help us to

68
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,466
spread the word and encourage others

69
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,066
to take this course too

70
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:20,466
in closing I hope you had fun during this course

71
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:21,966
and I want to thank you

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
for finishing this course

73
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,100
and both easy

74
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,500
and I look forward to hearing about the amazing things

75
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,300
that you build
