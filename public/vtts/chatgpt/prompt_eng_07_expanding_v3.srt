1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,300
expanding is the task of taking a shorter piece of text

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,266
such as a set of instructions or a list of topics

3
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:13,133
and having the larger language model

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,566
generate a longer piece of text such as

5
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:18,200
an email or an essay about some topic

6
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,133
there are some great uses of this

7
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:22,166
such as if you use a large language model

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,000
as a brainstorming partner

9
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:24,533
but

10
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:26,600
I just also want to acknowledge that there are some

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,566
problematic use cases of this

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,933
such as if someone were to use it they generate

13
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:32,533
a large amount of spam

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,266
so when you use these capabilities of a large

15
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,166
language model

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:36,900
please

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,000
use it only in a responsible way and in a way that

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,100
helps people

19
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:43,500
in this video we'll go through

20
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:46,566
an example of how you can use a language model to

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,766
generate a personalized

22
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,733
email based on some information

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,533
the email is kind of

24
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,300
self proclaimed to be from an AI bot

25
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,866
which as you mentioned is very important

26
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:57,733
we're also going to use

27
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:00,266
another one of the models input parameters

28
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,300
called temperature

29
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,966
and this kind of allows you to

30
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:04,866
vary the kind of degree of

31
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,900
exploration and variety

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
in the kind of models responses

33
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,600
so let's get into it

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,866
so before we get started we're going to

35
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,333
kind of do the usual setup

36
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,500
so set up

37
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,900
the Openai Python package

38
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,733
and then also define our help of function

39
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:20,733
get completion

40
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,800
and now we're going to write a custom

41
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,733
email response to a

42
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:25,766
customer review

43
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:29,466
and so given a customer review and the sentiment

44
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:32,000
we're going to generate a custom response

45
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,866
now we're going to use the language model to

46
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,933
generate a custom email to a customer

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,866
based on a customer review and the sentiment

48
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:42,900
of the review

49
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:45,366
so we've already extracted the sentiment

50
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,533
using the kind of

51
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:50,300
prompts that we saw in the inferring video

52
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:54,133
and then this is the customer view for a blender

53
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,133
and now we're going to customize the

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,966
reply based on the sentiment

55
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,200
and so here the instruction is

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,066
you are a customer service

57
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,400
AI assistant your task is to send an

58
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,266
email reply to a valued customer

59
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,666
given the customer email delimited by 3 baptics

60
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,800
generate are applied to thank the

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,933
customer for their review

62
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,800
if the sentiment is positive or neutral

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
thank them for their review

64
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,966
if the sentiment is negative

65
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,000
apologize and suggest that they can reach out to

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,100
customer service

67
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,766
make sure to use specific details from the review

68
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:27,800
write in a concise and professional tone

69
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,300
and sign the email as AI customer agent

70
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,700
and when you're using

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,966
a language model to

72
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:35,400
generate text that you're going to show to a user

73
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:36,533
it's very important

74
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,800
to have this kind of transparency

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,000
and let the user know that the text they're seeing was

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,500
generated by AI

77
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,133
and then we'll just input the customer review

78
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,400
and the review sentiment

79
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,866
and also note that this pop isn't necessarily important

80
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:51,333
because

81
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,900
we could actually use this prompt to also extract

82
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,966
the review sentiment and then in a follow up step

83
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:56,866
write the email

84
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,766
but just for the sake of the example

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,100
well

86
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,400
we've already extracted the sentiment from the review

87
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:06,133
and so here we have a response to the customer

88
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,366
it addresses details that

89
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,500
the customer mentioned in their review

90
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,100
and as we instructed

91
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,366
suggest that they reach out to customer service

92
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:18,400
because this is just an AI customer service agent

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,533
next we're going to use

94
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:26,666
a parameter of the language model called temperature

95
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,466
that will allow us to

96
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,733
change the kind of variety of the models responses

97
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,133
so you can kind of think of temperature as

98
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,200
the degree

99
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,466
of expiration or kind of randomness of the model

100
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,666
and so for this particular phrase my favorite food is

101
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,100
the kind of most

102
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:48,066
likely next word that the model predicts is pizza

103
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,200
and the kind of next to most likely it

104
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,166
suggests are sushi and tacos

105
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,800
and so at a temperature of 0

106
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,333
the model will always choose the most likely next word

107
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,700
which in this case is pizza

108
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,133
and at a higher temperature

109
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,866
it will also choose one of the less likely words

110
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,133
and at an even higher temperature

111
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,500
it might even choose tacos

112
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,866
which only kind of has a 5 percent chance

113
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:09,733
of being chosen

114
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,133
and you can imagine that kind of

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,133
as the model continues

116
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:17,300
this final response so my favorite food is pizza

117
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,533
and it kind of continues to generate more words

118
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,733
this response will kind of diverge from

119
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:25,366
the first response which is my favorite food is tacos

120
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,266
and so as the kind of model continues

121
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,600
these two responses will become more and more different

122
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:34,000
in general when building applications where you want a

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,866
predictable

124
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,933
response I would recommend using temperature 0

125
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,066
throughout all of these videos we've

126
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,533
been using temperature 0

127
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,466
and I think that

128
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:44,466
if you're trying to build a system that is

129
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:47,300
reliable and predictable you should go with this

130
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:48,533
if you're trying to

131
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,466
use the model

132
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,700
in a more creative way where you might want

133
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,466
a kind of wider variety of different outputs

134
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:56,733
you might want to use a higher temperature

135
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,700
so now let's take this same prompt that we just used

136
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,300
and let's try generating an email

137
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
but let's use a higher temperature

138
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:09,133
so in our get completion function

139
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,566
that we've been using throughout the videos

140
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,066
we have kind of specified a model

141
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:15,300
and then also a temperature

142
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,700
but we've kind of set them to default

143
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,666
so now let's try varying the temperature

144
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,900
so we use the prompt and then

145
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,700
let's try temperature 0.7

146
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,566
and so with temperature 0

147
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,466
every time you execute the same prompt

148
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,400
you should expect

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,666
the same completion

150
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,700
whereas with temperature 0.7

151
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,900
you'll get a different output every time

152
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:46,700
so here we have

153
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,666
our email and as you can see it's different to

154
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,933
the email that we kind of received previously

155
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,766
and let's just execute it again

156
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:57,733
to show that we'll get a different email again

157
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,533
and here we have another different email

158
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:04,100
so I recommend that you kind of play

159
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,666
around with temperature yourself

160
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,700
maybe you could pause the video now and try this

161
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:12,533
prompt with a variety of different temperatures

162
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:14,366
just to see how the outputs vary

163
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,066
so to summarise

164
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,766
at higher temperatures the outputs from the model

165
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:21,533
are kind of more random

166
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:21,966
you can

167
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,333
almost think of it as that at higher temperatures

168
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,133
the assistant

169
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:26,766
is more distractable but

170
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:28,133
maybe more creative
