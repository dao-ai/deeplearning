1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,166
there's so much text in today's world

2
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:08,700
pretty much none of us have

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,900
enough time to read all the things we wish

4
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:12,166
we had time to

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,500
so one of the most

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,300
exciting applications I've seen of large

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,900
language models is use it

8
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,500
to summarize text

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,266
and this is something that I'm seeing

10
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,066
multiple teams built into

11
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:24,100
multiple software applications

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,933
you can do this in the Chart GPT web interface

13
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,933
I do this all the time to summarise articles

14
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,000
so I can just kind of

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,000
read the content of many more articles than I

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,900
previously could

17
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,200
and if you want to do this more programmatically

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,266
you'll see how to in this lesson

19
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:38,466
so with that

20
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,766
let's dig into the code to see how you could

21
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:43,000
use this yourself to summarise text

22
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,900
so let's start off with the same

23
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,566
starter code as you saw before

24
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:47,966
of import openai

25
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,700
load the API key and here's that get completion

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,900
Holper function

27
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,166
I'm going to use as

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,200
a running example

29
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:00,300
the task of summarizing this product review

30
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,900
got this Panda plush toy

31
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,533
from a daughter's

32
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:04,466
birthday who loves it and takes it everywhere

33
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:05,766
and so on and so on

34
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,200
if you're building an e commerce website

35
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,466
and there's just a large volume of reviews

36
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:14,300
having a tool

37
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,133
to summarise the lengthy reviews could give you a way

38
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,400
to very quickly

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,300
glance over more reviews to get a better sense of what

40
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,133
all your customers are thinking

41
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:26,600
so here's a prompt for generating a summary

42
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,366
your task is generally short

43
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:30,366
some we have a probably review from e commerce website

44
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:31,566
summarize review below

45
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:35,100
and so on in Atmos 30 words

46
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,166
and so this is

47
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,133
Softencupe Panda plush toy loved by daughter a

48
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,366
bit smaller than a price arrive early

49
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:44,933
not bad it's a pretty good summary

50
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:47,700
and as you saw in the previous video

51
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,500
you can also play with things like

52
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,733
controlling the character count

53
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,366
or the number of sentences

54
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:55,166
to affect the length of this summary

55
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,066
now

56
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:58,566
sometimes when creating a summary if you have a very

57
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,800
specific purpose in mind for the summary

58
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,666
for example if you want to give feedback

59
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,333
to the shipping department

60
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,400
you can also modify the prompt

61
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:08,400
to reflect that

62
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,666
so that they can generate a summary that is

63
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:12,133
more applicable

64
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,300
to one particularly group in your business

65
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,800
so for example if I add

66
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,166
to give

67
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:20,900
feedback

68
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,533
to the

69
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,500
shipping department

70
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:29,166
let's say I changed this too start to focus on

71
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,666
any aspects that I mentioned

72
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,400
shipping and delivery of the product

73
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,733
and if I run this then

74
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:40,133
again you get a summary

75
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,266
but instead of starting off with

76
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:43,933
Softing Cupanda plush toy

77
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,766
it now focuses on the fact that it arrived a day

78
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,566
earlier

79
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,533
than expected and then the store has you know

80
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:51,566
other details then

81
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,466
or as another example if we aren't

82
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,300
trying to give feedback to the shipping department

83
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,066
but let's say we want to give feedback

84
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,933
to the pricing department

85
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,266
so the pricing department is

86
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,900
responsible determining the price of the product

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,166
and

88
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm going to tell it to focus on

89
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,333
any aspects

90
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,933
they're relevant to the price and perceive value

91
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,733
then just generates a different summary

92
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,533
that it says maybe the price may be too high for a size

93
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,333
now in the some reads that I've

94
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,466
generated for the shipping department or the

95
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
pricing department it

96
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:42,300
focus a bit more on information relevant

97
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,266
to those specific departments

98
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,900
and in fact feel free to pause the video now and

99
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:50,566
maybe ask it to generate information for

100
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,366
the product department responsible for the cosmic

101
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,566
experience of the product

102
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,733
or for something else that you think

103
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,200
might be interesting to an

104
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,800
e commerce site

105
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,100
but in these summaries

106
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,500
even though it generated the information

107
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,133
relevant to shipping it had

108
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,733
some other information too which you could decide

109
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,366
may or may not be helpful

110
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,766
so

111
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:16,600
depending on how you want to summarise it you can also

112
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:22,166
ask it to extract information rather than summarize it

113
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,366
so here's a prompt that says

114
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:26,733
Utah's extract relevant information

115
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,766
to give feedback to shipping department and now

116
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,733
it just says probably arrived a day earlier

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,066
than expected

118
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:35,300
without all of the

119
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,333
other information

120
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,133
which was also hopeful in the general summary but

121
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,900
less specific to the

122
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:41,800
shipping department

123
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,966
if all I wanted to know is

124
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,300
what happened with the shipping

125
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:48,266
lastly let me just share of you a concrete example

126
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:51,366
for how to use this in a workflow to help

127
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,100
summarize multiple reviews

128
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
to make them easier to read

129
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,333
so

130
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,166
here are a few reviews this is kind of long but

131
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,400
here's the second review for a standing lamp

132
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
need a lamp from a bedroom

133
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:07,300
here's a third review for an electric toothbrush

134
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,100
my dental hygienist recommended

135
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,933
kind of a long review about a electric tube brush

136
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,166
this is a review for a blender when it's at so set 17

137
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,766
pieces to someone seasonal sale and so on and so on

138
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:20,133
this is actually a lot of texts

139
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,733
if you want feel free to pause the video

140
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,066
and read through all this text

141
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,966
but one of you want to know what these

142
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,566
reviewers wrotes without having to

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,100
stop and read all this in detail

144
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,333
so I'm going to set review 1

145
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,166
to be just the product review that we had up there

146
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,966
and I'm gonna put all of these reviews into a list

147
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,533
and now if I implement a

148
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,200
full loop over the reviews

149
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,100
so here's my prompt

150
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,600
and here I've asked it to summarise it in at most

151
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,300
20 words then let's have it

152
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,366
get the response and print it out and let's run that

153
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:11,400
and it prints out

154
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,000
the first review is that Panda toy review

155
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,700
some really review of the lamp

156
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,000
some review of the toothbrush and then the blender

157
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,666
and so if you have

158
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:26,100
websites where you have

159
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,133
hundreds of reviews you can imagine

160
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,866
how you might use this to build a dashboard to take

161
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,333
huge numbers of reviews

162
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,533
generate summaries of them so that

163
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:39,900
you or someone else can browse the reviews much more

164
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,800
quickly and then if they wish maybe click in

165
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,400
to see the original longer review and this can help you

166
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,800
efficiently get a better sense of what

167
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,566
all of your customers are thinking

168
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:53,600
alright

169
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,000
so that's it for summarizing and I hope that you can

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,666

00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,600
if you have any applications with many pieces of text

172
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,600
how you can use

173
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,500
prompts like these to summarize them to help people

174
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:06,800
quickly get a sense of what's in the text

175
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,133
the many pieces of text

176
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:10,966
and perhaps optionally dig in more if they wish

177
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,666
in the next video

178
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,333
we'll look at

179
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,800
another capability of lash language models

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,666
which is to make inferences

181
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,600
using text for example

182
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,600
whether you had

183
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,166
a game product reviews and you wanted to very quickly

184
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,200
get a sense of

185
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:28,366
which product reviews have a positive or negative

186
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,300
sentiment

187
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,300
let's take a look at how to do that in the next video
